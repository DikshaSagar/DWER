    "The examples focus on enabling users to:\n",
    "- access data remotely via THREDDS\n",
    "- inspect available variables and metadata\n",
    "- explore spatial and temporal patterns in selected climate variables\n",

    "## Data access approach\n",
    "NARCliM 2.0 data are accessed directly from the NCI THREDDS server using the\n",
    "OPeNDAP protocol. This allows users to work with large climate datasets without\n",
    "downloading complete files, supporting lightweight and reproducible analysis.\n",
