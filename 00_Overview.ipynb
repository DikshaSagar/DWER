    "# Western Australia Climate Data Analysis (Prototype)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository provides a set of reusable Jupyter notebooks demonstrating\n",
    "how climate model data hosted on the NCI THREDDS (OpenDAP) infrastructure\n",
    "can be accessed, analysed, and visualised using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are designed as a lightweight, extensible analysis framework\n",
    "for rapid exploratory analysis and internal workflows, with minimal\n",
    "assumptions about the underlying dataset beyond standard CF-compliant\n",
    "metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary design goals of this work are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable direct access to remotely hosted climate datasets without local downloads\n",
    "- Provide clear, readable Jupyter notebook examples suitable for technical users\n",
    "- Support portable execution via GitHub/Binder for easy sharing and reuse\n",
    "- Ensure analysis logic is generic and easily transferable to future datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current examples use NARCliM 2.0 outputs, the structure and methods\n",
    "are intentionally dataset-agnostic and are expected to be directly applicable\n",
    "to future climate datasets hosted on NCI, including CSI products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial focus is on Western Australia, with notebooks organised to reflect\n",
    "common climate analysis groupings such as mean climate conditions, temperature\n",
    "extremes, precipitation extremes, and regional summary statistics.\n"
